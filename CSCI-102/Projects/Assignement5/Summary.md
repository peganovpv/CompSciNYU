# Tic Tac Toe Game 

### Modify the attached Tic Tac Toe game to do 3 things:
#### 1) Player  O picks a move to Win if possible
#### 2) Assuming PlayerO can not win, Player X or O will block if possible.
#### 3) Have both players win and block when possible - what are the final counts given 2 smart (but still random) players?You should only be changing the Play method.
