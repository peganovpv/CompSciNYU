# Assignement 3

## Print AVL Tree

### In this project you will populate a Binary Search Tree   (BST), specifically an AVL tree and print out its contents. The goal of the exercise to produce a reasonable facsimile of the tree. Since we are limited by output to the console line, the actual display can not be a perfect graphical representation of the tree. The lines of the trees are not exact but give the symbolic relationships.

### A Main Class and MyAVLTreeMap class have been provided. The main class will use the class provided by the book to build the AVL tree. The example provided builds the 3 trees for you, ( though you are requested to include 2 more trees of your own.) that will call methods the AVL class provided. Each element of the tree has a key which is a letter of the input, and value of 1. The value of each element is this project is not relevant.
### The main class defines the inputs, creates the AVL and calls the print method (which you will write), in order to display the tree. You should use this code “as is”, and put your work into the printTree method of the MyAVLMapTree class.
### Your goal is to complete the PrintTree method in the MyAVLTreeMap class.
