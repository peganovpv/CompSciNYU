# Merge Sort


### Populate an  two arrays each with 1,000 students with id numbers .  Generate an ID number by starting with "N" and then adding an 8 digit number. The other fields (e.g. name ) can all be the same. Dont worry if id numbers are duplicate.

### 1. OUTPUT 1: Sort each array and count comparisons for a n squared sort (pick either bubble,  selection) from last class. Then combine the arrays into a larger array, where the first elements are array1 and the second elements are array  Sort this large array using the same sort as before. Count comparisons. It should be n2.2 
### OUTPUT 2: Modify the regular MergeSort from the book (under Sorting folder) to count comparisons.  Sort the array using MergeSort

### Your output should show the number of comparisons  of the  arrays with the n squared sort, and then the number of comparisons using a Merge Sort (after sorting the initial arrays)
